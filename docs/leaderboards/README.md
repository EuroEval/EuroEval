## ðŸ“Š How to Read the Leaderboards

The main score columns are the `nlu_rank` and `nlg_rank` columns, showing the [mean rank
score](/methodology) of the model across all [NLU and NLG tasks](/tasks),
respectively. The lower the rank, the better the model.

The columns that follow the rank columns are metadata about the model:

- `num_model_parameters`: The total number of parameters in the model, in millions.
- `vocabulary_size`: The size of the model's vocabulary, in thousands.
- `max_sequence_length`: The maximum number of tokens that the model can process at a
  time.
- `commercially_licensed`: Whether the model can be used for commercial purposes. See
  [here](/faq.md) for more information.
- `merge`: Whether the model is a merge of other models.
- `speed`: The inference time of the model - see more [here](/tasks/speed).

After these metadata columns, the individual scores for each dataset is shown. Each
dataset has a primary and secondary score - see what these are on the [task
page](/tasks). Lastly, the final columns show the ScandEval version used to benchmark
the given model on each of the datasets.

To read more about the individual datasets, see the [datasets](/datasets) page. Uf
you're interested in the methodology behind the benchmark, see the
[methodology](/methodology) page.
